          description="Cabro laying is a cornerstone of our services, demanding meticulous attention to detail from the initial ground preparation to the flawless final finish. We meticulously remove problematic soil types, such as black cotton soil, until a stable and firm ground is achieved. This is followed by precise backfilling with murram and thorough compaction using heavy-duty roller compactors. The final 300mm depth is filled with hand-packed hardcore, which is also expertly roller-compacted for maximum stability. Fine aggregate is then laid on top before the paving blocks are expertly arranged and securely held together on the edges by robust concrete kerbs. Our precise approach guarantees smooth, durable, and aesthetically pleasing cabro surfaces perfect for roads, car parks, and expansive outdoor areas, built to withstand heavy traffic and environmental elements."
